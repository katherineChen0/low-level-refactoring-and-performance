Setup
1. extracted randall-git.tgz which contained an existing Git repo
2. initialized a new GitHub repo 
3. copied local repo to Github
4. verfied files appear on GitHub

reviewed existing code:
- randall.c is monolithic program generating random bytes
- makefile builds the program and can create tarballs
- current Makefile lacks test functionality

expanded Makefile's check to include:
- output length verification
- randomness check- clear pass/fail reporting for each test case
- auto cleanup of test artifacts

verified test functionality:
- confirmed test pass w working implementation
